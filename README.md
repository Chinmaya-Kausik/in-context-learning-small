# Small-scale experiments with in context learning using transformers

Experiments with in context learning using simple function classes, reproducing and extending work in this paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01066).

Formulated a Bayesian prior-learning hypothesis for the efficacy of in-context learning in transformers. You can find the project's website [here](https://chinmaya-kausik.github.io/projects/in-context-learning/).
